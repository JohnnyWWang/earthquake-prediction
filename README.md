This is for AI: Machine Learning for Earthquake Prediction - Shell Project. 

## The code_injection.py is the code to processs the injection data. 
It will create a excel of five columns - Injection Date, Water or Steam Injected (bbl), Well #, Latitude and Longitude.
Because the size of data is large, the running time of code_v1 would last for about twenty minutes.


## The code_production.py is the code to processs the production data. 
It will create a excel of six columns - Production Date, Oil Produced (bbl), Water Produced (bbl), Well #, Latitude and Longitude.
Because the size of data is large, the running time of code_production would last for about one hours.

## The upscale_code,ipynb is the code to upscale the well location and make the well location plots.
